# -Rate-Limiter-LRU-Cache
Rate Limiter &amp; LRU Cache System Implemented a rate limiter to prevent API abuse and an LRU cache to manage limited memory efficiently. Optimized for constant-time operations using appropriate data structures. The project simulates real-world backend scenarios such as request throttling, traffic control, and in-memory caching.
